    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    Below, we are fetching Venus data from `planetURL` using Axios.
    Edit the success handler and console log the whole `response`. Can you find the data from the API?
    Inside the success handler, use the data inside the response to print out the following string:
      "Venus is a planet 12104 Km in diameter, with a rotation period of 243 hours.".
    But the string must be built using the data from the API, as opposed to simply copying and pasting the text above.
    You can then try fetching different planets by editing the planet id at the end of the `planetURL`.
    */
    const planetURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets/2'
    axios.get(planetURL)
      .then(response => {
        const {name, diameter, rotation_period} = response.data
        console.log(`
        ${name} is a planet with a diameter of "${diameter}" and rotation period around the sun of "${rotation_period}" days to complete.
        `)
      })

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Use Axios to get information about Pluto from the `baseURL`. You will need to add the planet id at the end of `baseURL`!
    On success, print to the console "I am not sure Pluto is a planet!" (obtaining the word "Pluto" from inside the response data).
    */
    const baseURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets/'
    axios.get(baseURL + 9)
      .then(rez => {
        const {name} = rez.data
        console.log(`
        Some still aren't sure if ${name} is a planet, but it surely is.
        `)
    })

    /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    Use Axios to get information from the `badURL`. Because a planet with id `12345` does not exist, this request will reject.
    Create a catch handler that takes `error` as its argument, and prints to the console "Sorry, planet with id 12345 does not exist".
    Also inside the handler, print to the console the status code found inside `error.response`.
    Also print to the console the contents of `error.response.data.message` (this is the actual error message from the server).
    */
    const badURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets/12345'
    axios.get(badURL)
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(
          err.response.status
        )
        console.log(
          err.response.data.message
        )
        console.log(
          `Sorry, planet with id "12345" is not currently available.`
        )
      })
