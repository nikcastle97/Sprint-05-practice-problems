    // I will say again, as a mentor/techer/etc... it is NOT CONSTRUCTIVE to intentionally attempt to trick or misguide your students with common-place questions. Many students take those teching them completely at their word and this oftentimes results in a misunderstanding of core fundementals and it is wrong! Especially when individuals are paying a hefty sum for their education.
