    <!-- 👉 Extract the CSS rules below to the `styles.css` stylesheet found in this project.

  <h1>Splitting HTML, CSS, JS Into Separate Files</h1>
  <p>The problems involve extracting the CSS and the JavaScript out of the HTML and into dedicated files.</p>
  <p>If they are solved correctly, the logo should render exactly the same way.</p>
  <div id="logo"></div>
    <!-- ❗ PROBLEM 2
    👉 Extract the JavaScript code below (do not worry about how it works) to the `index.js` file.
    👉 After this is done, remove this <script> tag and link your `index.js` to the HTML using a <script> tag with a `src` atribute pointing to the file.
    👉 Placement of the <script> tag is important. If the code affects the HTML, then the script must be placed **after** the elements the script cares about.
    👉 An alternative to this is placing the <script> inside the <head>, but adding to the <script> a `defer` attribute. -->
